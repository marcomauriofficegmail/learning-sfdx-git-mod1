# INSTRUCTIONS MODULE 1 
In this step you'll create a new repository, and perform a push in your scratch org of the GIFTER app.

1) Clone this repository
2) Check that you have a trailhead playground (or a Developer edition Org that supports Dev Hub) and that is linked to your prompt. You can use the command sfdx force:org:list to see the list of every org linked in your prompt.
3) create a new scratch org with the command: sfdx force:org:create and specify the right parameter
4) Perform a push in your scratch org already created.
5) remember to set your language to English in your settings --> language.
6) assign the permission set "GIFter" to your current user in salesforce.

Ok when you complete the step 6 of Module 1, you can jump to the next section, switching to the branch "learning-git-module2", always reading the README file.
